This is code for the Interactive Benzoltisch at Deutsches Museum in Bonn.

The implementation is based on a Teensy 2.0 and the Arduino 0022 IDE.

In October 2011, the microcontroller-based implementation replaced the previously used wired connection of the reed switches with a play button box to control the video player (a EYEZONE B1080P-2) in the table.

The Teensy now controls the video player directly using an infrared LED and the NEC IR codes that I pried from the button box.
